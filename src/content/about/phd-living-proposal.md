# 'Living' PhD Proposal

## Motivations and Aims

## What I Have Done
- A tonne of masters compsci/datasci modules
- Autoethnographic studies
- Thoroughly rejected Rnns and symbolic generation

## What I am currently doing
- Literature review on explanations for audio
- Recruiting for interview study on sample manipulation
- Technical study on....

## What I will do
- Workshops, participatory design
- Evaluation...?

## Intersting questions
- Can context/multimodality assist with explanations? 
- Furthermore, can this be used to build an exlpanation into an interactive device? (for example haptic feedback for exploring timbre space)
- What does sampling look like with neural audio processes?
- How can we 'perform' sample-based music any differently?
