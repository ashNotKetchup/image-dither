Hi, I’m Ash – an artist, researcher and composer.
My work explores human-computer interaction, knowledge representation and personal data science (mainly for the arts).
My primary occupation is a PhD in Artificial Intelligence and Music, where I am investigating the implications of explainable AI for human-computer music generation.
If you would like to collaborate, or have any questions about my work, feel free to contact me at:
