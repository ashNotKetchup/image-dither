An exploration of digital site-specificity, this project places the user in a chaotically-deterministic loop. Since parameters change with each iteration, they must take time to figure out how the ecosystem works, and then sensitively compose with it, rather than into it. I see this as engaging with the intersection of instrument design with theories of sound ecologies. I am also using some machine learning and controller mapping to achieve this.

This project marks the second in my series “Grain FM”, an exploration of physical modelling and granular sampling/synthesis. In this particular manifestation, transients are mapped equidistantly about the unit circle, and then granularly sampled as controlled by weather data and gyroscopic controls.

<!-- TODO:Basically I want images to share the width, while being the same height, or on mobile to take the full width

Convert this to parse just markdown images, this is too verbose
