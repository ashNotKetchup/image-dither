This interdisciplinary project at the University of Warwick explored the ways in which timbre could be visualised, using matrix processes on a sinusoidal decomposition (in this case the result of short term and discrete fourier transforms).

*This is an old project, and as such, Iâ€™m struggling to find abstractions for the projects mentioned. I may make an updated version, which I will post here. For now, here is a demo of spectral combination, a precursor to the midi combination found in the following post.*
