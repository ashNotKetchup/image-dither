<!-- ## Background -->

Sampling – the manipulation and playback of existing audio – is a tried and tested method for the composition of new sound works. As well as lowering the barrier of entry for complex sound design tasks, the use of samples can also provide novel and meaningful ways of relating with and between cultural data.
<!-- interacting with cultural and meta-textual 'data'. -->

<!-- Existing sampling methods () have offered novel means of interacting with  for decades……eg -->
Recent advances in digital signal processing suggest a new frontier in audio processing. Deep learning tools present opportunities for manipulating audio in new ways. However, the actual interactions which underpin the creation and deployment of these tools have been largely ignored. 

<!-- With sampling’s rich history for interfacing between people and data, it presents a unique opportunity to explore the challenges and oppurtunities for human interaction with real-time deep learning systems. -->


<!-- Despite potential for audio transformation in this domain, the actual interactions which underpin the creation and deployment of these tools have been largely ignored....(nise) Similarly, sampling's rich history for data manipultion as...is also yet to be explored in the domain of ai....? -->

<!-- they are routinely ignored by advances in ai/dsp technology. Existing for.. retrieval -->

This work, part of [my PhD in Human-Centred Artificial Intelligence and Music](/about/Stage-1/living-phd-update) seeks to inform the design of new systems for sampling, exploring challenges and oppurtunities for human interaction with real-time deep learning systems along the way.
<!-- how we create fair, personalisable, and explainable AI systems  -->
<!-- along the way. -->
<!-- As well as try to learn sample-ry approaches for a more just meta-textual ai.  -->


## Ways to Get Involved

Below is a list of ways you can get involved in the project. It will be updated as oppurtunities start and end, so dont worry if it's different from last time!

### 1: Tell Me About Sampling and You

Existing research into musicians and samples primarily focusses on the musical function of a sample. This is great! But I want to understand the *process*. How do you think about sampling? How does it make you feel? How do you think your favourite sampler work? Are you (n)ever thinking about sampling? Should we even call it that?

- If you want to rant at me via email, send me your music, or just ask questions – you can! I'm at `a.l.noel-hirst[at]qmul[dot]ac[dot]uk` and I'd love to hear from you.

- We are also recruiting for a small number of one-off interviews about samples. We have **funding** to compensate people for interviews at around £40-£60 per hour [^1]. Email me for more info.

[^1]: Subject to number of participants
### 2: Keep an Eye out

Future work (pending the results and funding from pilot), will include workshops and open source software for sampling devices which leverage explainable AI.

### 3: Ask Me Questions/Make Suggestions

If you don't understand some of my work, or the reasons for why I've done something, please ask! Similarly, if you think I could be doing something a better way, or if I'm covering something which has already been done to death, let me know via email `a.l.noel-hirst[at]qmul[dot]ac[dot]uk`. 
<!-- I spend criminaly little time in my emails, so help me out  -->
