Performers can progress the piece by typing the endless text, triggering environmental and nondiegetic sounds with keywords. They can also deviate from the instructions, or use the microphone to resonate their voice.\nThrough this exercise, I hope to probe at opportunities to challenge and reform our interactions with technology, as well as with music. My Nana was a typist and a seamstress, unnoticed virtuosities I could only dream of, contorting her to technologies (adversarially designed to the extent that it impacted other aspects of her life).</p>\n<p>How is this not music?</p>\n<p>Similarly, how is the mechanical reproduction of a score any more worthy of attention? We must reshape our means of creating artefacts, and we must begin to appreciate artefacts outside of their appeal to capitalism and its artifices.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Live decoding","subtitle":null,"date":"Sunday, 1 October 2023","author":"Ash"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/design/Live decoding/index","breadcrumb":{"location":"/design/Live decoding/index/","crumbs":[{"pathname":"/","crumbLabel":"Home"},{"pathname":"/design","crumbLabel":"design"},{"pathname":"/design/Live decoding","crumbLabel":"Live decoding"},{"pathname":"/design/Live decoding/index","crumbLabel":"index"}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
