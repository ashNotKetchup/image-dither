This is great! But I want to understand the <em>process</em>. How do you think about sampling? How does it make you feel? How do you think your favourite sampler work? Are you (n)ever thinking about sampling? Should we even call it that?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If you want to rant at me via email, send me your music, or just ask questions – you can! I'm at <code>a.l.noel-hirst[at]qmul[dot]ac[dot]uk</code> and I'd love to hear from you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We are also recruiting for a small number of one-off interviews about samples. We have <strong>funding</strong> to compensate people for interviews at around £40-£60 per hour <sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>.
